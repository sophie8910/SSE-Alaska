# Research on Gradual and Sudden Movement of Tectonic Plates from Shallow to Deep in Alaska Subduction Zones

What are the factors that control such slow and fast ruptures, the underlying physical mechanism and the potential linkages between these phenomena?

### Published Datasets (Datasets Folder)
1. Table S1: Estimated East and North Components of GPS velocities for Co-Located Sites in Sand Point (SNDP, AB07 and LSDP). 
2. Table S2: GPS site locations, velocities and associated uncertainties in the horizontal (east and north) component and vertical component, and names. Velocities are based on the survey period (1992 - 2016). 
3. Table S3: GPS site locations, velocities and associated uncertainties in the horizontal (east and north) component, and names for sites used in estimating the new pole for PENN block in Text S2 (Survey period: 1992 - 2016). Sites were chosen based on an observed lack of subduction-related strain, and we assume that this component is zero (rigid body rotation only).
