Table S2: GPS site locations, velocities and associated uncertainties in the horizontal (east and north) component and vertical component, and names. Velocities are based on the survey period (1992 - 2016). 
Column 1. Station Names; 
Column 2. Site position, Longitude; 
Column 3. Site position, Latitude; 
Column 4. East velocity (mm/yr); 
Column 5. East standard deviation (mm/yr); 
Column 6. North velocity (mm/yr); 
Column 7. North standard deviation (mm/yr); 
Column 8. Vertical velocity (mm/yr); 
Column 9. Vertical standard deviation (mm/yr).

Table S3: GPS site locations, velocities and associated uncertainties in the horizontal (east and north) component, and names for sites used in estimating the new pole for PENN block in Text S2 (Survey period: 1992 - 2016). Sites were chosen based on an observed lack of subduction-related strain, and we assume that this component is zero (rigid body rotation only).
